# s3FileManager
Small project on s3 using swing to allow users to download, preview and upload files to s3.
to build the application run: gradle build , and then java -jar build/libs/s3Manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
you need to have at least java 8 to run this program as it uses method references and lambda functions.

I hope you like it
