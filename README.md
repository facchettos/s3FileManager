# s3FileManager
Small project on s3 using swing to allow users to download, preview and upload files to s3.

This small application was part of a school project on cloud services, you will need to have a credential file from amazon in the default location to be able to access your files. (check it out on the aws website).

This is not yet finished, I'll work on it when I have time. You can send me your feedbacks on the project through the issues part of this repo.


I hope you will like it.
